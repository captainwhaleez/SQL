# Chicago Data Project Using SQL

This folder contains the SQL queries used to investigate Chicago's census, education, and crime data. The datasets are part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science), used during the ['Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) course final project.

### Questions to be investigated during this analysis

**Problem 1:** Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.

**Problem 2:** List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.

**Problem 3:** List all case numbers for crimes involving minors?

**Problem 4:** List all kidnapping crimes involving a child (children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)?

**Problem 5:** What kind of crimes were recorded at schools?

**Problem 6:** List the average safety score for all types of schools.

**Problem 7:** List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line.

**Problem 8:** Which community area(number) is most crime prone?

**Problem 9:** Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index.

**Problem 10:** Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?

Upon analysis, we find that communities with a per-capita income lower than $11.000 seem to share harder socioeconomic conditions (measured by the hardship index) and a higher crime rate.
