# COVID 19 Data Exploration with SQL

This folder contains the .sql file used to carry out exploratory analysis on the Coronavirus (COVID 19) Deaths dataset available [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

The dataset is updated daily. This analysis was conducted on May 22, 2022. 

The dataset was divided into COVID Deaths and COVID vaccines information. The correspondent csv files are available in this folder.

For MySQL Workbench users, importing large csv files through the GUI might not work. Converting the csv into SQL is recommended (it will save you time. Belive me.)
